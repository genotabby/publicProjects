Description
-------------
This is a classic Reversi game using the Orthello rules. This game was implemented using HTML, CSS and Javascript while attending the Software Immersive course at General Assembly. 
I chose Reversi as it is a visually complex game when done manually in person and is one of my favourite traditional board games.

Objective
-------------
The objective of the game is to have the majority of discs facing up on the board showing one's own colour at the end of the game. The game ends when there are no more possible moves and the winner is the player with the most pieces.

Rules
-------------
1. Black always moves first.

2. If on your turn you cannot outflank and flip at least one opposing disc, your turn is forfeited and your opponent moves
again. However, if a move is available to you, you may not forfeit your turn. 

3. Players may not skip over their own colour disc(s) to outflank an opposing disc. 

4. Disc(s) may only be outflanked as a direct result of a move and must fall in the direct line of the disc placed down.

5. All discs outflanked in any one move must be flipped, even if it is to the player's advantage not to flip them at all. 

5. Once a disc is placed on a square, it can never be moved to another square later in the game. 

7. When it is no longer possible for either player to move, the game is over. Discs are counted and the player with the majority of their colour showing is the winner.

Note: It is possible for a game to end before all 64 squares are filled.

Rules were obtained from https://www.worldothello.org/about/about-othello/othello-rules/official-rules/english

How to play
-------------
This version of Tetris allows some flexibility by allowing a range of board sizes to be chosen.

<br>
Using the official rules from the [World Orthello Federation](https://www.worldothello.org/), black would start first and the objective of this game is to obtain more points than your opponent by having more of your colour covering the board.

<br>
Take over the opponents pieces by flanking them with your colour and turning them into your colour. It is possible to reverse multiple pieces in the 8 directions in one turn.

Possible placements are shown on the board and you may select one of the placements to make your move. Once your piece is placed, the turn goes over to your opponent.
